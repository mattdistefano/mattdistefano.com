# Getting married

I posted some pictures last month and wrote briefly about getting married, but with the Eagle Creek fire fast approaching the site of our ceremony, I'm thinking now is a good time to memorialize the event.

We always intended on a very small ceremony, perhaps even eloping. Neither of us was big on a Big Fancy Wedding. We settled initially on parents only; then grandparents (hers) and brothers (mine). Then a ceremony + reception for extended family. Then a ceremony + reception + dinner the night before with whoever was in town.

We did a lot of work in the months leading up to the wedding. Argued a little, either over things that didn't matter or things that did. 

We debated locations. Where would hold significance for us? Where would be suitable for our traveling or elderly guests? We discussed food. Would we cater? Do more of a picnic-style dinner and grill on site? Pick up from a local grocery store? 

Meaghan was smart and bought a dress early. I bought about 10 suits, 8 shirts, 4 ties, and 2 belts in the last 2 months; obviously, I returned most of them. We both picked up matching metallic rose gold Chuck Taylors to go with our rose gold bands and her engagement ring.

We started planning on google docs and moved eventually to trello. I built a [website](http://stetzifano.com), coining, in the process, a surname that we, alas, did not adopt. Meaghan designed an invitation and had a rubber stamp made so we could print them all by hand (two stamps, actually --- neither of us, apparently, was much for proof-reading). We sent out RSVPs w/ tiny self-addressed, pre-stamped return envelopes; too tiny, in fact, for the post office to actually mail. Surprisingly, we still got 2 or 3 of them back.

Finally we settled on a location: Oxbow Park. We'd been there years ago, early in our relationship, on a bike camping trip that'd been memorable, if a bit disastrous (arriving in the park, exhausted, intending to cook dinner over the fire only to find --- surprise --- they weren't selling firewood). We made a quick trip over the winter to scope things out and settled on the Dragonfly picnic area. It was just off the Sandy River, well-isolated from the rest of the park, ringed by old-growth timber, with an open meadow adjacent to the rustic shelter structure.

Meaghan made the arrangements with the park, and we biked to Blue Lake Park in early summer to pick up parking passes for everyone. Being in much worse shape than we were in that first ride to Oxbow 8 years ago, the 30 miles round-trip to Blue Lake hurt about as much.

Eventually we found a caterer and officiant. We surreptitiously visited the caterer's restaurant in Sellwood, and met more officially with our officiant in inner SE, just down the street from our first apartment.

We opted to do our own decorations and beverage service. We made... many trips to Ikea. Meaghan drank about 10 gallons of kombucha to obtain purple bottles to use in our centerpieces, along with flowers sourced from our CSA. Being Matt and Meaghan, we ordered a giant bag of custom M&Ms (the last of which are, 2.5 months later, still in our fridge) for the tables. Meaghan made citronella candles in cut-off wine bottles, and cushions for the Ikea benches (I assembled the benches; so I can say I did *something*). 

Even with things kinda-sorta planned out, the days leading up to the wedding were hectic. With the ceremony on Saturday, we made our last shopping trip something like Wednesday night. Meaghan finished the last cushion around the same time. I picked up my suit from the tailor on Thursday, and spent Friday shopping for yet another shirt. Somewhere in there I also got a hair cut. Meaghan had a minor mix-up with some jewelry off esty; the correct piece arrived Thursday or Friday. We picked up our flowers, brewed iced tea, assembled the furniture for the ceremony, and test-fit everything into our cars. 

Friday night we had dinner at Ned Ludd; we rented their patio space, which was, of course, beautiful. We had around 15 guests in town at this point. The dinner was a family-style chef's choice with half a dozen courses of 2 or 3 different dishes each; everything was excellent. Our parents met for the first time earlier Friday and thankfully got along.

Saturday we loaded up early; I'm sure we had breakfast but I don't remember what. Meaghan took off to get her hair done and pick up our dessert. I headed out to the park to get a jump on set-up. It was thankfully fairly simple; we didn't have a big ceremony, after all, and though we had decorations, we were letting the natural beauty of the park do most of the heavy lifting for us. But there were water jugs to fill; iced tea and lemonade stations to set up; flowers to arrange; benches and vases to stage in the meadow. 

Family trickled in before the ceremony and helped get things into place. My niece and nephew chalked a sign at the entrance to the picnic area. Meaghan arrived an hour or so before the ceremony and changed into her dress; I changed into my suit, mostly in my car (not recommended).

We had our ceremony around 2. We'd at one point been worried about rain, but if anything the weather was a little too nice, hitting mid-90s by early afternoon. The spot we'd originally planned for the ceremony was much too sunny, and we relocated down the meadow a bit into the shade of the trees. We exchanged vows and *I do*s; Meaghan cried (in a good way). We'd written our own vows, and they came out just about perfect. A spider dangled from a length of web just above Meaghan's head for the duration of the ceremony; it was odd, but also not out of place. Meaghan looked great in her dress; I felt slightly silly in my suit.

After the ceremony we broke for pictures. The caterers had arrived during the ceremony. We helped some with the table settings, but mostly just wandered around a little dazed. Dinner, likewise, was a little bit of a blur, but the food was again excellent. We had a minor mishap with the dessert but it worked out in the end.

Needing to be out of the park by early evening, we rushed to pack up and say goodbyes after dinner. The suit and dress went back into their bags, and we headed home only to pack up again for the weekend. We got out of Portland around 9 that night, blasting our respective wedding mixes on the way to the coast for a couple nights of exhausted lounging and hot-tubbing.
