# Rainier 2018

Meaghan and I visited Mt Rainier together for the first time in 2016. We'd both been there on family trips when younger, but this was our first time visiting together.

In 2016, we went for her family reunion. Meaghan drove while I surreptitiously exchanged emails w/ [a jeweler](https://aidememoirejewelry.com/) arranging a deposit for an engagement ring. I failed miserably to start a fire, and the next day we hiked the [skyline trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/skyline). It was more intense than we had anticipated.

This year, we made a fire together (literally, a fire) easily. I was getting over a cold, so we kept the hiking light. Paradise was packed by 10:00, so we joined the crush of other tourists up to Alta Vista, then broke off down Deadhorse Creek, Moraine, and finally around Nisqually Vista. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but once we left Alta Vista we had the trail mostly to ourselves.
